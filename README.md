## Pokedex JavaScript

A Pokedex using JavaScript.
I did not have the time to finish adding the bonus functionality, but I'm
still pretty happy with how much I managed to do on terms of the CSS
design.

The things the assignment asked for are done, but I couldn't do any of
the bonus stuff I originally wanted to, sadly.

For the upload, I removed a lot of the bonus stuff that was in progress,
and I also will not include the image I was using, as it's not mine

I also dedicated a bit more time to planning the CSS, which, while not finished,
still is much more organized than last time.
